# MindCore · Atlas

> **Lock the look. Tell the story.**

MindCore · Atlas is a CLI-first, deterministic design accelerator for hackathons that generates a complete **design system foundation**—tokens, themes, and configs—so teams can move fast without visual chaos.

Atlas eliminates design indecision, survives pivots, and enforces visual consistency from first commit to final demo.

---

## Why Atlas Exists

Hackathon teams lose points because:

- Design decisions happen too late
- Pivots destroy visual consistency
- UI looks stitched together
- Storytelling is unclear or nonexistent

Atlas removes design as a bottleneck by **locking visual identity early** and encoding narrative intent directly into the design system.

## Core Principles

- **Hackathon-first**
- **Decision elimination**
- **Deterministic output**
- **Local-only**
- **No authentication**
- **Fast execution**
- **Pivot-safe design**

Atlas is strict by design..
